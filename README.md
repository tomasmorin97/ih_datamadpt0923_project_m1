Welcome to the world of sustainable mobility. We will analyze two urban initiatives: Bicimad and Biciparkd. Our goal is to facilitate communications between sports centers and bike parks and to understand how these bicycle transportation options contribute to the sustainability of our city and improve the quality of life of its inhabitants.

Both proposals offer innovative solutions to encourage the use of bicycles as a means of transportation in urban environments.

## 🙋 Name
Bicimad & Bicipark Application

## 👶 Status

## 🏃 One-liner
Explore the world of urban cycling with Bicimad & Bicipark Explorer a project to analyze and visualize data from two prominent bike-sharing initiatives.

## 💥 Core technical concepts and inspiration
The objective of Bicimad & Bicipark Explorer is to provide a complete overview of bicycle parking near our sports facilities, allowing users to compare and contrast the availability of Bicimad and Bicipark. The project is inspired by the growing importance of sustainable urban mobility and the need for instant information on this data.

We use geolocation techniques to provide accurate results based on the user's location. This allows us to identify and visualize the nearest sports facilities and bike stations in real time.

We implement fuzzy matching algorithms to improve search capabilities. These algorithms allow us to find approximate matches between text strings, making it easier to identify locations even when there are typos or differences in naming.

## 🔧 Configuration
Requirements
- Python3 
- Pandas as pd
- Requests
- Numpy as np
- Fuzz and process from fuzzywuzzy

Prerequisites
- Python:
Bicimad & Bicipark Explorer is built using Python. Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.
- Pandas:
Bicimad & Bicipark Explorer relies on the Pandas library for data manipulation. Install it using the command:
```sh
pip install pandas
```
- FuzzyWuzzy:
FuzzyWuzzy is used for fuzzy string matching. Install it using the command:
```sh
pip install fuzzywuzzy
```
Installation Instructions:
